# Drills

Drills is a repository contains upgrade and longevity **exercises** for Concourse. The purpose of these tests are for an extension of the core Concourse testing (topgun and testflight) where the upgrade tests are for testing specific upgrade paths and the longevity tests are for long running pipelines that will test the performance of the current development version.

* **Upgrade path testing**: these are specific, targeted tests for tricky cases we can think of before and after a _specific_ upgrade path like v4.2.2 to v5.0.0.
  
  * Example: the migration for #2386 and how we represent paused/disabled resource state.
  * Success means: "before" test suite passes before the upgrade, and the "after" suite passes after the upgrade.
  
* **Longevity/soak testing**: these are not tied to specific upgrade paths, and are meant to be a realistic (yet consistently measurable) workload exercising common _and_ corner cases.
  
  * Example: running unit test builds periodically, exercising things like tagged workers, etc.
  * Success means: the same workloads have the same results before and after the upgrade.
  
* **Performance testing**: similar to longevity testing, but we may have more specific examples (e.g. running Docker builds, running on tagged + untagged workers, running tests that do a bunch of I/O with tiny files, etc. etc.)
  
  * Examples: running Docker builds, running builds with many tasks to exercise container scheduling, configuring pipelines that share resources across teams/etc. to exercise #2386.
  * Success means: resource utilization (e.g. # containers, CPU, RAM) stayed the same or went down, builds took the same amount of time or became faster, and there are no observable leaks over time (goroutine, memory, etc).

## How to run the tests

### Upgrade Tests

  1. Deploy your "before" environment
  
  2. Go into the `pre` folder in the upgrade path you want to run `eg, /drills/upgrade/4.2.2-5.0.0/pre`
  
  3. Set the required environment variables (they should be specified within each folder's README)
  
  4. Run the script to sets up and tests the environment
  ```
  ./run-all
  ````
  
  5. Upgrade your environment
  
  6. Go into the `post` folder `eg, /drills/upgrade/4.2.2-5.0.0/post`
  
  7. Run the script that tests the upgraded environment
  ```
  ./run-all
  ````
  
## Longevity Tests

  1. Deploy your "before" environment
  
  2. Go into the test folder
  ```
    cd /drills/longevity
  ```
  
  3. Run the script that sets all the pipelines
  ```
  ./run-all
  ````
  
  4. Observe the metrics
  
  5. Upgrade your environment
  
  6. Compare the metrics
